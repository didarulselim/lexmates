              <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;">Civil law is a legal system originating and intellectualised within the framework of common law, the key feature of which is that its core principles are codified into a referable system which serves as the prime source of law. Civil law, or civilian law, also known as private law, regulates disputes between private persons or corporate entities. There are differences in cases dealing with matters between people and the government, i.e. public law and criminal law. Civil law deals with issues such as title, contracts, property, inheritance and family law.
                <br><br>
                In the legal world, "The best battle is often the battle never fought." Lexmates also advises clients on how to avoid litigation. Before using a new, possibly innovative, product we can do a patent search for you. Before using a new trademark or service mark we can search to see if anyone else is using a confusingly similar mark. If you are in business or going into business we can tell you the probable result of the signing of a contract or what will happen if you breach a previously signed contract. We are experienced in many other areas. Please do not hesitate to ask about any issue.
                <br><br>
                If you have a civil matter and are not sure what to do about it we would be happy to sit down with you and discuss the situation. We will not charge you for this initial consultation if you do not retain us. Our aim is to help you obtain the best results at the lowest cost.
                <br><br>
                On civil matters we have represented clients at all levels of the Bangladesh Courts, including the District Judge Courts, all Tribunals and Supreme Court of Bangladesh.

              <p class="card-text" style="text-align: justify;">
                Constitutional interpretations by the Honorable Court have played an important role in settling political problems as well as other issues involving individuals and parties. These interpretations have also restricted or expanded the scope of action of different functionaries of the Government and enabled individuals and groups to enjoy constitutional and legal protection. The Supreme Court of America, in a case held that an unconstitutional act is not a law, it confers no rights, it imposes no duties, it creates no offence and this act is inoperative as it has never been passed. The Superior Courts in Pakistan also support this viewpoint. In all matters, aggrieved person can avail the statutory remedy of Appeal or Revision, which is not sometimes adequate, effective, efficacious, convenient, beneficiary and expeditious. In such situations the aggrieved party can avail the extra ordinary remedy by invoking constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, which is obviously speedy and effective remedy and foster the justice. These conditions occasionally overlap or conflict with each other.
                <br><br>
                A writ is an official written directive issued by an organisation with administrative or judicial jurisdiction; in modern sense, this organisation is known as a court. There are many types of writs exist including prerogative writs, summons and warrants but there are many others.
                <br><br>
                The writ, in common parlance, is an order issued by a court in the name of an authority requiring the performance of a specific act.
                <br><br>
                The Lexmates team has moved numerous Writ petitions in the High Court division of Supreme Courts of Bangladesh on different issues such as Appoint Related Matter in Government Service, Election matters, Land Survey Tribunal Issue, etc.

<strong>AREAS OF SPECIALISATION</strong><br><br>
Marriage-<br>
We assist for marriage registration for Muslim, Hindu, Christian, Buddhist and others religions. We also assist for inter-religion marriage under Special Marriage Act 1872 including multinational citizen. Bangladeshi and Foreigner can register their marriage in accordance with The Special Marriage Act, 1872.
<br><br>
Divorce – <br>
Under Bangladesh Law, a divorce is the legal procedure of terminating a marriage. Divorce often involves dealing with matrimonial issues such as the custody of the children, maintenance, and division of assets.<br><br>

Maintenance – <br>
Maintenance is a form of financial assistance. Once divorce procedures have commenced, an application for maintenance can be filed in Court.<br><br>

Deed of Separation – <br>
A deed of separation is a private agreement between husband and wife stating the various terms and conditions of the separation. This document can assist couples in deciding on the most crucial aspects of living apart before dissolving their marriage, such as child custody and asset division, as well as avoiding disputes in court.<br><br>

Prenuptial Agreements – <br>
A prenuptial agreement is an agreement that a couple enters into before getting married and which documents their respective positions in the event of a divorce. A prenuptial agreement may also include specific terms governing the marriage or the couple’s rights and obligations during the marriage in some situations.<br><br>

Custody / Care and Control – <br>
Custody, Care and Control to children form part of the ancillary matters to be decided after an interim judgment of divorce has been granted. Ultimately, the Family Court will have regard to the wishes of the parents, and the wishes of the child, or children.<br><br>

Adoption – <br>
Under the Adoption of Child Act, married couples can adopt a child. Where birth parents are unable or unwilling to care for their children, adoption helps these children find a lifelong family to care for and nurture them.<br><br>

Personal Protection Order – <br>
A Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) is an order restraining someone from using violence against a family member. If the perpetrator breaches the order and harms the victim again, a police report must be made.<br>
